# Leisure Collections

This is a personal project created during boring job seeking time. It is a web application that I can upload my 4k movies and episodes so that I can watch them without the limitation of video rate. It is also a project that I created for self-practicing purpose. As a result, it has not been completely finished. Subtitles and other functionalities will be added in the future. Currently, it only supports video upload and watching.

I used AWS Amplify to host the application, S3 bucket to store the images and videos, and GraphQL for indexing. Other frontend and backend development such as implementation of video player, routing, and CSS are done using React.
